üîê Face Recognition System using AWS Cloud Services
This project is a cloud-native, AI-powered facial recognition system designed using various AWS services to provide real-time identity verification, emotion detection, and facial attribute analysis. It leverages the power of Amazon Rekognition and AWS Lambda to deliver a highly scalable, secure, and efficient facial analysis solution.

üöÄ Project Overview
We have developed a Facial Attribute Recognition System that:

Detects faces in uploaded images.

Analyzes various facial features like emotion, gender, age, eye/mouth state, beard presence, and eyewear.

Uses cloud infrastructure for scalability, real-time performance, and cost-effectiveness.

üß† Key AWS Services Used
Amazon Rekognition: AI service for detecting and analyzing facial features.

Amazon S3: Cloud storage for images and associated metadata.

AWS Lambda: Serverless compute to handle backend tasks without managing servers.

AWS IAM: Manages secure access control and authentication for AWS resources.

üéØ Objectives
‚úÖ Build a robust facial recognition system using AWS services.

‚úÖ Enable real-time face detection, attribute analysis, and emotion recognition.

‚úÖ Ensure data security and privacy using AWS IAM and S3 encryption.

‚úÖ Optimize performance and reduce cost using serverless architecture.



Use python 3.7.9

# steps to run code

1 Create aws account if not created yet.
  Link - for creation - https://aws.amazon.com/
  
2 Create a **user** using IAM management Console in aws account with one Policy named as **AmazonRekognitionFullAccess**
  After creating user it will provide a csv file which contains credentials . 
  
  csv file name - new_user_credentials.csv
  
3 Download csv file and copy that file to Facial-Analysis-using-Amazon-Rekognition Directory

4 Install all library mentioned in requiremets.txt

5 then run app.py file.
